Easy Access is a comprehensive and easy to use Android Application tailored to the needs of people that face mobility difficulties. 
It utilizes the native voice recognition API provided by Android and provides commands that correspond to certain functionalities.

Easy Access was implemented as my Thesis project as an Undergraduate student at University of Piraeus.
